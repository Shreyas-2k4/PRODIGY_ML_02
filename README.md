Project: Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

In this project, we implement a K-Means clustering algorithm to group retail store customers based on their purchase history. Clustering customers allows us to identify distinct customer segments, gain insights into their behaviors, and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

Prerequisites:

Python 3.x
Required Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn (You can install these libraries using pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn)
Project Structure:

data: Contains the customers.csv file with customer purchase history data.
src:
data_preprocessing.py: Handles data loading, missing value handling, and normalization.
kmeans_clustering.py: Implements the K-Means clustering algorithm.
visualize.py: Provides visualization functions for cluster analysis.
README.md: Project documentation.
main.py: Integrates all steps and executes the clustering process.
Data:

The customers.csv file includes the following columns:
CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
PurchaseHistory: Historical purchase data (e.g., total spending, number of purchases).
Steps:

Data Preprocessing:
Load data from customers.csv.
Handle missing values (if any).
Normalize purchase history data for better clustering performance.
K-Means Clustering:
Implement the K-Means algorithm.
Choose the appropriate number of clusters (k) using methods like the Elbow method.
Fit the model to the normalized data.
Visualization:
Visualize clusters using 2D scatter plots.
Optionally, apply dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA) for high-dimensional data.
Main Script (main.py):
Integrate all steps.
Execute the script to perform clustering and visualize results.
Feel free to customize and execute the code according to your specific dataset! üòäüõçÔ∏è
